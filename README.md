HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fight poverty and provide the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid. 

The goal of this project is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country and suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.
